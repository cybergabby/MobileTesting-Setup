Taking my mobile penetration testing skills to the next level! Just finished configuring Android Studio and installing Google APIs for Android 9 to set up a proper testing environment for APK analysis.

This isn’t just about running an app every step, from setup to hands-on testing, is enhancing my ability to dissect mobile applications, understand their behavior, and identify potential security vulnerabilities. 

Mobile security is a whole world of its own, and being able to test in a realistic environment means I can simulate real-world attacks, uncover weaknesses before they become problems, and refine my skills as a Application Security Engineer

Excited to keep pushing boundaries, learning more, and turning every APK into a playground for ethical hacking and skill mastery.
